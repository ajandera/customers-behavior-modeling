\chapter*{Introduction}

The goal of my bachelor thesis is to create an Matlab Live script based on assets of the Mathematical models belongs to customer's behavior with mainly focus on e-commerce.
As initial data we will use anonymize data from Megaplay s.r.o stores, both online and offline stores, and open data from
google.com, heureka.sk, heureka.cz and statistical data served by government from years\\ 2018-2019 and then try to predict the income of 1/2020.
As the reference of prediction we will calculate basic statistical methods over that data. Explanation of reference data see in section~\ref{sec:statistics}.
Then we will use behavior models which will be composed especially to simulate customer behavior which is responsible for
buy action with specific point which are important in e-commerce business.\\
As a model demonstration we will used Live script created in Matlab \footnote{MATLAB is a fourth-generation programming
language and numerical analysis environment.
Uses for MATLAB include matrix calculations, developing and running algorithms, creating user interfaces (UI) and data visualization.}
which will have preprocessed income data and all cosntants needed to create prediction of future income
as output with graphical demonstration of prediction.
As a reference method to our models will be used statistics results of Time series and than we compare our model results with basic Time series predictions. For each method we will calculate aberration of the prediction.

\section*{Task formulation}

Creating a mathematical model to predict customer behavior consist of vendor, psychology and loyalty sub-models combine in hidden markov model to final prediction mechanism which should have better results than Time series analyze.

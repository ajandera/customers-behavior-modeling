\chapter*{Introduction}

The goal of the thesis is create an Matlab application based on assets of the mathematical models belongs to human behavior with mainly focus on e-commerce.
As initial data we will use anonymize data from Megaplay s.r.o stores, both online and offline stores, and open data from
google and statistics data served by government from years\\ 2018-2019 and then try to predict the turnover of 2020.
As the reference of prediction we will calculate basic statistics method over that data, for more details see section~\ref{sec:statistics}.
Then we will use behavior models which will be composed especially to simulate human behavior which is responsible for
buy action with specific point which are important in the online world.\\
As a model demonstration will be used application created in Matlab \footnote{MATLAB is a fourth-generation programming
language and numerical analysis environment.
Uses for MATLAB include matrix calculations, developing and running algorithms, creating user interfaces (UI) and data visualization.}
which will have preprocessed csv files with all needed data as input and get probability prediction of next year income
as output with graphical demonstration of prediction.
As a reference method to our models will be used statistics results of time series and than we compare our model results with
basic time series predictions.


\section*{Task formulation}

Create a mathematical model to predict customer behavior consist of vendor, psychology and loyalty sub-models combine in hidden markov model to final prediction model
which should have better results than time series analyze and polynomial prediction.

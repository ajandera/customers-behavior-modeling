\chapter{Summary} \label{summary}
I my thesis I focused on a model creation to predict customer behavior based on previous store data and open data available in online tools.
As a reference I use regular statistic methods generally used by store owners.
From tested statistic approaches was the best result comes from linear regression of $Tr_{t2}=a_0+a_1t+a_2t^2$ which predict store income with aberration about 14.5\%.
My set goal was to create a better mechanism to predict this important data for each business based on e-commerce solutions.
To pass that goal I used mechanisms used for behavior prediction and mathematical approaches which are usually used in other industries like an autonomous driving,
telecommunications or mechanism which are used to introduce new products on market.
Mechanisms and approaches I have learned during the work of this thesis give me the ability to create my own vendro, psychology and loyalty models which are the
base of the final prediction model and help me to finish the goal which I set to me at the beginning of the work.
This main goal was passed by successfully prediction with aberration about 3\%.
This passed goal of my thesis was fulfilled in cooperation with the business owner to show me the deep of his industry to set constants for my model with a minimal deflection.
In the next thesis it will be good to clearly define mechanisms to set this industry constants only on ordinarily accessible data with consultation with business owners.
Then it will be good to minimize random generate number with a matrix create with real data of store
In my original design was prediction for a half of the year 2020, but the pandemic situation which start of the beginning of the year 2020 change my plans,
so I create prediction only for the first month of the 2020.
The situation in the industry was change in an unexpected way and modeling that situation was beyond this thesis, but the results of the thesis is enough to show that standard
simple statistics approaches are not enough for prediction customer behavior in a 21st century, so we have to look on the sophisticated approaches like a mathematical modeling.
Evolution of computer technology give the power to get more complicated calculation to more users and should be used to get the more relevant data for entrepreneurs to improve their businesses.
My model is actually combined myself models with statistical solution like Hidden Markov model.
In the future improves it will be the right way to leave all statics mechanism and as a combination approach use differential equation.
When that equation will be found it open the new way of store data prediction from predefined states to dynamically updated states and show the results in realtime to reflect actual visitors and income on each store.
